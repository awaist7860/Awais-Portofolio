                    My main job was to repair mobile phones and laptops and other electronics. I also made software tools such as batch files to assist me in fixing mobile software problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My secondary job was to interact with customers and try to sell products to them. I worked there as a volunteer so that I could build up my work experience and learn new life skills.

                    In this job, I am selling duvet covers and mattresses and other products on an online eBay shop. I used to pack the products and send them off. I also used to interact with the customers online to make sure that they were satisfied with our service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My biggest accomplishment was being able to handle the dissatisfied customers and to convince them to feel happy about their purchase and our service and to make them a repeat customer.
