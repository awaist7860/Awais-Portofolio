								<p>My main job was to repair mobile phones and laptops and other electronics.</p>
                                <p>I also made software tools such as batch files to assist me in fixing mobile software problems.</p>
                                <p>I made a stock management software in Visual Basic.net for my boss.</p>
                                <p>The stock data was stored in text files, and the software made automatic backups every night</p>
                                <p>The front end was made in Visual Studio.</p>
                                <p>I also made the business website using <a href="https://kingcommunication.business.site/">Google's website builder</a> and I registered the business on Google search.</p>
                                <p>My secondary job was to interact with customers and try to sell products to them.</p>
                                <p>I worked there as a volunteer so that I could build up my work experience and learn new life skills.</p>

								<p>In this job, I am selling duvet covers and mattresses and other products on an online eBay shop. I used to pack the products and send them off.</p>
                                <p>I also used to interact with the customers online to make sure that they were satisfied with our service.</p>
                                <p>Over the summer holidays in 2020, from May to October I had to lead a team in making a stock management system for the business.</p>
                                <p>We used Microsoft SQL Server for the backend and used C#.Net for the communication between the front end and back end.</p>
                                <p>The front end was made in Visual Studio.</p>
                                <p>My biggest accomplishment was being able to handle the dissatisfied customers and to convince them to feel happy about their purchase and our service and to make them a repeat customer.</p>
                                <p>Another accomplishment that I had was that I was able to lead a team in achieving one goal.</p>
